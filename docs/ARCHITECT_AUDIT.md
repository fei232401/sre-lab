## Remediation Tracker

### Phase 1 — Pre-Audit Baseline (B+: 85/100)

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| A1 | No LICENSE file | 🔴 Critical |
| A2 | No badges in README | 🔴 Critical |
| A3 | No Table of Contents | 🔴 Critical |
| A4 | README architecture diagram is raw ASCII | 🔴 Critical |
| B1 | 3 docs with ~40% content overlap | 🟡 High |
| B2 | No CHANGELOG | 🟡 High |
| B3 | "下一步" section looks like unfinished work | 🟡 High |
| B4 | Sub-README files are minimal | 🟡 High |

### Phase 2 — Post-Remediation (A-: 91/100)

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| A1 | No LICENSE file | ✅ **Fixed** — MIT LICENSE added |
| A2 | No badges in README | ✅ **Fixed** — Python, FastAPI, Ollama, license, status, platform badges |
| A3 | No Table of Contents | ✅ **Fixed** — TOC with anchor links |
| A4 | Architecture diagram is raw ASCII | ✅ **Fixed** — Clean ASCII with legend, connection labels |
| B1 | ~40% content overlap across 3 docs | ✅ **Fixed** — Each doc has distinct responsibility (see Document Map below) |
| B2 | No CHANGELOG | ✅ **Fixed** — CHANGELOG.md with v1.0→v2.0 entries |
| B3 | "下一步" looks unfinished | ✅ **Fixed** — Moved to structured Roadmap with status |
| B4 | Sub-READMEs are minimal | ✅ **Fixed** — Design Decision sections added to all 4 module READMEs |

## Document Map (Single Source of Truth)

Each topic has exactly one authoritative location. Cross-references replace duplication.

| Topic | Authoritative Source | Referenced From |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Environment baseline | README.md | All docs via links |
| Architecture diagram | README.md | PROJECT_NARRATIVE (simplified inline) |
| Quick start commands | README.md | All module READMEs |
| T-001 ~ T-005 troubleshooting | `docs/troubleshooting.md` | README, PROJECT_NARRATIVE (summary only) |
| Full benchmark data | README.md & PROJECT_NARRATIVE Ch.8 | FINAL_REPORT (summary) |
| Interview Q&A | PROJECT_NARRATIVE Ch.11 | README (abbreviated) |
| File manifest | PROJECT_NARRATIVE Ch.10 | All (one source) |
| Design decisions | Module READMEs (`01/`, `02/`, `03/`, `04/`) | PROJECT_NARRATIVE (context) |
| Version history | CHANGELOG.md | README |

## Remaining Opportunities (Nice to Have, Not Required)

| # | Idea | Effort |
|---|------|--------|
| C1 | `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup guide for contributors | Low |
| C2 | Standalone `benchmark_data.md` in tabular format for citation | Low |
| C3 | Architecture decision records (ADR) for SSE vs WebSocket, Token Bucket vs Leaky Bucket | Medium |
| C4 | GitHub Actions CI for lint + benchmark replay | Medium |
